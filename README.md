**Week 3: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Basics**

## **Overview**
In this week my focus was on understanding and implementing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, including encapsulation, inheritance, and working with classes and objects.

## **Tasks Completed**

1. **Student Class Implementation**
   - Developed a **Student** class with attributes such as **name**, **age**, **standard**, **roll no** and **grades**.
   - Implemented methods to **calculate the average grade** and **display student details**.

2. **BankAccount Class with Encapsulation and Inheritance**
   - Created a **BankAccount** class demonstrating encapsulation by keeping balance as a private attribute.
   - Implemented deposit and withdrawal methods with validation.
   - Extended functionality by creating a **SavingsAccount** subclass inheriting from **BankAccount**.

3. **Library Management System**
   - Designed a basic library system using OOP principles.
   - Created **Book** and **Library** classes to manage books.
   - Implemented methods to **borrow** and **return** books while maintaining records.

## **Challenges and Learnings**
- Gained a better understanding of encapsulation and why private attributes are useful.
- Practiced implementing inheritance and extending class functionalities.
- Faced some challenges with method interactions but resolved them through debugging and testing.

## **Next Steps**
- Explore more advanced OOP concepts like polymorphism and abstraction.
- Implement a more complex project using multiple classes and real-world interactions.
